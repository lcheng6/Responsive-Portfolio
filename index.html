          <p>
            I'm fairly new to HTML, but I'm super excited to understand all ways to visually engage my readers through the dynamic language of web and HTML. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I started many years ago with Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.  During my college years, I've always ignored HTML and front-end programming. I never felt I had enough to share with the world.  Over the years, I've gained a lot of confidence in communication; and I have a lot more interesting topics that I can communicate with my friends and coworkers.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm trying to catch up with the people I really respect; those who have both the technical depth and the ability to engage people through all mediums of communication.  I'm on a mission to learn web development as fast as possible.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm so excited to attend the GWU Coding Bootcamp.  Not only will I learn web development; I will also learn from wide personal experience within the student body.
